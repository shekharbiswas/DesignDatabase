"AMD Ryzen 9 3900X 12-core, 24-thread unlocked desktop processor with Wraith Prism LED Cooler","The forbidden machine","This thing arrived in the mail like any ole package. For me it was just another boring day, I decided to open the box and take a peak inside.... immediately the sun shined down its ray of light and people were harmoniously singing in the background. I immediately shouted to be quiet, I didnt want them ruining this moment. I reached in the box with my sweaty clammy hands and pulled out the ryzen 9 box. I stared at it...... and it stared at me. I couldnt wait any longer, I rushed in the lab where I began ripping the box from the PC. Standing outside my door all you could hear was the clanking of metal and the sound of sparks as I installed this beautiful piece of hardware in my PC. I knew what I had was magic.... it was one of a kind. I wanted to show it off so I headed to an Intel convention where people shrieked and ran in terror. They knew what I had brought was over thirteen levels higher than their most powerful tool.... the i9. After all of this, all I have been through I could finally say I had the better processor. Anyways, I would reccomend!","15 Jul 2019","Style: Processor","Yes","Danny S. Richey","5.0"
"AMD Ryzen 9 3900X 12-core, 24-thread unlocked desktop processor with Wraith Prism LED Cooler","RIP Intel","Intel's coffin has arrived. Coming from an i5-7600k never have a been able to multitask so smoothly with an Intel CPU.","06 Jul 2019","Style: Processor","No","Waldo","5.0"
"AMD Ryzen 9 3900X 12-core, 24-thread unlocked desktop processor with Wraith Prism LED Cooler","Powerhouse","Phenomenal CPU, absolutely crushes Intel's 9900k (which is roughly the same price) at most tasks.  Intel does have a slightly higher base clock speed so it has a slight edge on single core benchmarks - though this 3900x has plenty of room for overclocking and exceeds the Intel at single core tasks for the same clock speed. The extra cores and threads on this CPU set it above the rest for real-world tests and multicore benchmarks.  Excellent CPU for streaming, gaming, video editing/rendering, and just about anything else. The only reason not to buy this is if you are going to wait for the 3950x in September, which has 2 more cores and 4 more threads for $250 more. I highly recommend this CPU, and also suggest pairing it with one of the new x570 motherboards - I have the ASUS Crosshair VIII Hero myself and love it. Update:  Cable management is important of course.  CPU cooler that ships with this CPU is solid, haven't had any issues so far.","09 Jul 2019","Style: Processor","Yes","Robert L.","5.0"
"AMD Ryzen 9 3900X 12-core, 24-thread unlocked desktop processor with Wraith Prism LED Cooler","Biggest generational  jump in performance in my CPU purchasing history (30 years)","I’ve owned Intel from 80386 (386) to 6700k Skylake, AMD Athlon 64, Ryzen 1700 and now I just upgraded to 3900x.  What an amazing CPU, with the incredible jump in IPC performance, even Adobe Lightroom is faster, Lightroom(!), do you know how hard it is to move that glacier. I’ve heard some gripes about there not being much headroom for overclocking.  I’ve overclocked every CPU in the past only because they left so much performance on the table.  This CPU appears to do a great job of getting every bit of performance out of it that overclocking for a minute gains is not worth it to me.  Its performance is monster straight out of the box, I think the early BIOS from the MB manufacturers are running the voltage a bit high on default settings.  I tried setting it at 1.3v but it made a big drop on boost performance.  I settled on leaving it on auto with an offset of -.1125 and I do not see a performance loss (Cinebench).","14 Jul 2019","Style: Processor","Yes","Emmanuel","5.0"
"AMD Ryzen 9 3900X 12-core, 24-thread unlocked desktop processor with Wraith Prism LED Cooler","Insane performance even with reduced power cap set","I managed to get it from Amazon by watch-dogging the page, but it took some effort because it barely stays up for a few minutes before people snap whatever stock there is up.  Hopefully the supply pipe will iron itself out so others aren't left just staring at pictures! The 3900X... well, its just insane.  As you can see I'm not using it on a desktop, so no gaming reviews here :-).  I actually have it in a rack doing bulk application builds, and in that regard the performance is really bordering on the insane side.  It wipes the floor with whatever I throw at it.  I have it in an ASRock B450M-PRO4 motherboard which worked great after (of course) I updated the BIOS. In this particular case I tested the CPU to around 150W on the socket (200W at the wall) and it performed excellently.  For my particular use-case, though, since I stuffed it into a 2U rack mount with a low-profile 65W air cooler, I decided that things were a little too toasty so I used the BIOS setup to limit the socket to 100W (150W at the wall).  The CPU is still a beast even limited in that fashion.  The 3900X at 100W socket (150W wall) is twice as fast as my 2700X is at 190W (wall), and ever faster if I let it stretch its legs.  It blows away everything I have except my TR2990WX.  I am very, very impressed. I will throw in a few provisios here for early adopters.  First, if you intend to stuff a Zen 2 CPU into an older motherboard remember that you have to update the BIOS first.  Second, the BIOSes are really early and some motherboard vendors haven't gotten updates out with the latest AMD AGESA, so if you are an early adopter on an older motherboard be prepared to face some difficulty.  I didn't have any problem with the B450M-PRO4 that I stuffed this 3900X into but I am having trouble POSTing a 3600X on a B350 Gaming-itx/ac.  It's clearly just an early BIOS issue since once I do get it to POST successfully (takes a number of tries), the system is rock solid. Third, I do NOT recommend that anyone try to overclock on these early BIOSes.  Wait for the BIOSes to mature a bit more because trying to do it on these early BIOSes runs a real risk of burning your chip up. Other than that, enjoy!  It's an incredible CPU. -Matt","13 Jul 2019","Style: Processor","Yes","M. Dillon","5.0"
"AMD Ryzen 9 3900X 12-core, 24-thread unlocked desktop processor with Wraith Prism LED Cooler","AMD finally delivers professional productivity to main streem PC users","Motherboard:  ASRock x370 Taichi Corsair Vengence 3200 RAM 32GB 500gb WD Black M.2 NVME boot drive 2 TB WD Black 7200 HHD storage drive 850w 80+Gold Cooler Master PS AMD r9 3900x Stock Speed (No OC) Cooler Master ML240L  AIO Liquid Cooler Cooler Master H500P Mesh case Found that the 3900x was not in stock on launch date, 7/7/19.  Set Amazon to notify me when available.  Got the message hit the 1-click-puchase button faster than I ever have.  The item was purchased 7/8/19 and shipped Tuesday 7/10.  I received the CPU safe and well packaged on Friday 7/12, a day earlier than Amazon quoted at time of shipment. After updating the BIOS, and running a few final benchmarks on my Asrock x370 Taichi motherboard, I shut down the system and removed my 1800x (this CPU will go into my daily driver system and relieve my r5 1600 CPU slated to be installed in Mom's PC).  Warning!  Make sure to move the AIO fan wire out of the way of the CPU die and the cooler surface.  I had a boot loop and overheating/shutdown session.  Was able to get into the BIOS and see the CPU temp at 101c Wow! LOL no wonder it was shutting off.  Anyway after seeing my stupid mistake, and re-seating the AIO cooler, the next boot-up took forever and 10 minutes to boot into Windows.  Once Windows recognized the CPU and it was running, I started running some benchmarks. Now, I'm not a gamer, so again I am comparing my work load of video editing and production as well as rendering.  With one commercial project alone, I my render time has dropped from around 20 minutes to 12 minutes... that's 40% improvement.  I can render some commercial projects up to 4 times per work session.  I've been very happy with the performance so far, but I'm absolutely blown away by this processor's ability.  Rendering a 1 hour 1080p video usually takes an 1h 10m or so.  I re-rendered last week's video and that time dropped down to around 42 minutes.  My productivity is going to go through the roof. Spending $500 on one single item that is smaller than the palm of your hand can be mind-blowing for some people.  It may also cause some heartache and possibly buyers remorse for others.  Here's the deal, when you consider purchasing this CPU, you must do some research.  Know exactly what you will be doing with your system to insure the performance gain is there.  If you are a gamer, this CPU will play every game very very well.  While it never claims to be the best in gaming, it is definitely meant for heavy work loads. What an outstanding and simple upgrade for a system that will provide another 4 years of great productivity. As a side note, I have been eyeing up an AMD Threadripper build for the past 9 months.  My work requires high core and thread counts which enable the jobs to render much faster.  I had already saved my money to invest into the 2950x and was still saving for the motherboard.  Considering the fact that I earn a living with my PC, a professional workstation is in order. While it's exciting to order a new ""toy"", I hope you plan for something like this.  It makes your purchase even sweeter when you ""just know"" you got a great product for a reasonable price, and it will do what you need it to do.  Also, looks like I need to update the name of my system now LOL.  It's not an 1800x any longer. Cheers!","13 Jul 2019","Style: Processor","Yes","relxerd","5.0"
"AMD Ryzen 9 3900X 12-core, 24-thread unlocked desktop processor with Wraith Prism LED Cooler","Great porformance for less money than Intel","I have not had the processor for very long, but its been great so far. My old processor the Ryzen 1700 was a good, but the 3900x essentially doubles the processing power it had. As far as single threaded apps you may not notice a huge difference. It's not until you use it on a CPU hungry program that you really notice a huge difference. I have mined a little bit of crypto just to test things out compared to the Ryzen 1700, it has doubled the hash rates it was getting. Other than that and running a few bench marks it hasn't been used a ton, but so far it been as good as the reviews online have been saying about it.","13 Jul 2019","Style: Processor","Yes","CRB","5.0"

"Intel Core i5-9600K Desktop Processor 6 Cores up to 4.6 GHz Turbo unlocked LGA1151 300 Series 95W","Why are you supporting this product?","2700x is literally an overall better CPU across more metrics. Intels screwing their customers by forcing hyperthreading on its next step up CPU. Either of the 2 are over priced garbage with not even 2% better performance than the 8700k in gaming. Do some research you will see this ""gen"" has 1-2 more FPS max in gaming compared to 8700k. That goes for the 9900k as well!! 9600k is the only one I would reccomend here. The 8700k is better than this for a cheaper cost because of its hyper threading. Buying more of these processors is only entitling intel to continue the outrageous price hike. First it was no improvements on their cpus for years. Now it's the same with this ""generation"" but a hefty slap in the face for cost.","12 Nov 2018","Style: 9700K","No","RandyMarsh","1.0"

"Intel Core i5-9600K Desktop Processor 6 Cores up to 4.6 GHz Turbo unlocked LGA1151 300 Series 95W","Intel 14nm has hit the ceiling","I'm torn with this processor. Moving up from the 6600k at 4.5Ghz that I ran for the past 2 years this processor obviously is much better than the first gen 14nm in productivity. However I can't say that I'm blown away by the gaming performance increase that I netted. Moving from an 8700k to this 9700k would make little to no sense at all. I put off finishing a new PC since March of this year for the z390 platform and it's accompanying 9th series chips. I don't feel like I would have missed out on much by utilizing z370 and the 8700k however. I have my 9700k overclocked at a stable 4.9Ghz across all cores with 1.250 volts on the vcore, but have not had luck being able to hit 5Ghz even at 1.4 volts. I'm not going to go higher for temperature reasons. Maybe it's my chip and the silicon lottery was not in my favor. Temperatures are fairly good for the packaged power. With my H150i Pro 360mm AIO and Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut my CPU will idle around 30 C with a room temp of 23 C. My 6600k idled at 24 C with a Hyper 212 evo. After 30 minutes on Prime95 I max around 80 C and it will not rise after any further length of testing.

It's fast, reliable and cooler than the previous i7, also very easily overclockable. This processor is so fast for everyday use and gaming I honestly can't think of anything bad to say about it. Having upgraded from an old system, it feels so completely different I cannot recommend it enough, however the best things about it (for me) is its performance while gaming and its thermals. Paired with a RTX 2080 this processor is able to deliver a stable 120+ FPS on most titles I tested in a 2K resolution, multitasking is also incredibly fast, haven't noticed any influence at all on games even with open software in the background. I have it OC'ed with 1.3 Volts Vcore to 5.0Ghz and right now, no problems in any stress tests I tried and I've done absolutely zero tinkering yet, it worked right ou of the box. I'm using a Noctua NH-U14S aircooler with 2 fans and usual load temps (while gaming) are in the high 50s low 60s, on all my stress tests the highest temp I got was 85oC under heavy AVX load, which is unbelievably cool for the setup I think. The soldered IHS is perfect for those who (like me) are not comfortable with deliding their CPUs giving us way better results for zero hassle. I think it's important to say that I'm running it in a (high end) Z370 motherboard and it's working perfectly.","12 Nov 2018","Style: 9700K","Yes","Cliente Amazon","5.0"
"Intel Core i5-9600K Desktop Processor 6 Cores up to 4.6 GHz Turbo unlocked LGA1151 300 Series 95W","Love these idle temps","Haven't seen idle temps this low since my 2600k thanks to the internal thermal material.  Under a custom water loop from EK, from what I've seen so far, they won't crack 30 degrees, even after being ran all day and gaming all day.  Always stays under 30 idle.  Easily over clocks to 5 GHz as well to get those benchmark scores a little higher.  Workstation-level of needs will most likely need to go with some more cores, however. Really happy with this new chip overall since I didn't/don't require 16 threads.  One of the top chips for gamers right now from what I've seen. Edit: got it running at 5.1 GHz @1.38v on all cores, uncore at 48. netted me a score on userbenchmark at 119%.

I compared my system vs my friends with a 2700x(Same graphic card). He has stable 4.3 OC and I am at 5.0 OC. I am averaging about 12-17% better frames. His ram and MB cost $270 more than my MB/Ram setup minus the $60 cooler I brought. So I saved $210 with better performance for gaming, which I can always put towards a better graphics card later.
